## Real-world Usage Examples

### 1. As-You-Type Validation
```typescript
// As developer types this line:
const db = drizzle(connectionString)

// System immediately responds with:
{
  "issues": [{
    "severity": "critical",
    "message": "Direct database access bypasses RLS",
    "suggestedFix": "const db = await getOrgDatabaseWithAuth()",
    "rule": "no-direct-db-access"
  }]
}
```

### 2. Intelligent Pattern Suggestions
```typescript
// Developer starts typing in API route:
export async function GET() {

// System suggests complete pattern:
{
  "suggestions": [{
    "type": "pattern",
    "code": `export async function GET() {
  try {
    const { user, orgSlug, role } = await requireAuthWithTenant()
    const db = await getOrgDatabaseWithAuth()
    
    const data = await db.select().from(table)
    return Response.json({ data })
  } catch (error) {
    return new Response('Internal Error', { status: 500 })
  }
}`
  }]
}
```

### 3. Proactive Error Prevention
```typescript
// Before developer runs into issues:
{
  "riskAssessment": {
    "overallRiskScore": 85,
    "riskLevel": "high"
  },
  "errorPredictions": {
    "errors": [{
      "type": "runtime",
      "severity": "high",
      "message": "Potential null pointer access: user.profile",
      "probability": 0.7,
      "prevention": {
        "suggestion": "Add null check before accessing property",
        "code": "user?.profile || if (user) { user.profile }"
